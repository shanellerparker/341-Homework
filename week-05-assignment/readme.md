# Week 'Five'

## Oh

So I wasn't quite expecting this assignment to be as difficult as it was for me. I read through the material and thought that I got it...I was a bit wrong. It wasn't as easy as I thought. I had some issues using the button actions and just trying to make things look half way decent image wise. I did however learn to respect those who do this for a living and the patience they must have.

## A little bit better

After making it through the first few drafts of my webpage I was finally get the hang of it, but then of course I had no idea what to do a questionnaire on. It was a bit frustrating. But it was actually pretty fun once the painful part was over. Now that we are getting a bit more into the specifics and just I guess deeper I really can't wait to start on using it just for my own personal website!

## All Done

I really did enjoy this assignment. However, a little bit relieved that it is over. I mean it was a lot of material to have to learn and try to get it right because a missing quotation will mess things up. But excited and scared for the next one!
