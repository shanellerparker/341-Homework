      Fire bombs bursting on the border lighting up the azure summer night. Their flame pulsate momentarily before settling to a flicker as the bombs fumes die down as quickly as they came. The Rogue Militia is at it again.
    They’ve been restless these past few months. Attacking the Pales on the outskirts of town, the high society ones with fortresses for houses to protect their classy asses. Look what it got them…bombs.
    Fiery bombs. I turn away from the bay window closing the the blinds, it doesn’t do much good since the riots and attacks are all over the news in the den. I shake my head before dragging my feet upstairs to my room.
    Moments after I shut my door I hear rapid foot steps follow me. One…two…three…

    ”Gail, honey can I come in?”
    </p>
    <p>
    	“Yes, mother.” I say as I throw myself on my bed waiting for her to lecture me about my semi-passing grades for the semester.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Prim and proper in her suit with perfect bouncing curls brushing her shoulder my mom enters with a curt smile. She sat next to me pulling down her suit to ensure it doesn’t wrinkle of course.
      She retrieves my report card from her email on her phone scrolling down to review my grades once more. “Your father and I have discussed this and we believe that perhaps we should look into a tutor for a couple of your core classes.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “I’ve told you I understand it. I just don’t see the point in knowing the stages of mitosis.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “It’s a foundation fo-“
    </p>
    <p>
    “I don’t want to be like you. I told you I want to go to a trade university.”
    </p>
    <p>
    My mom pauses before she clears her throat. “Honey, are you sure you really want to go to a school intended for Rogues?” she asks. Her nose crinkling slightly at the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
    “They’re the only schools that have artistic programs.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Of course they are. They are not for intellectuals from Pale families. Are you sure this whole painting isn’t just a phase?”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Mom.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “It’s just your father and I are concerned with your slipping grades and the William’s girl said you refused to join Tait to the prom. Are you going to-you know again?”
    </p>
    <p>
    I get up from my bed stepping in front of her. “You know you can say it. I’m not a some fragile doll.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Calm down. You know what I meant.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “Look just because I don’t want to go to prom or become a cookie cutter Pale teenager doesn’t mean I’m going to hurt myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
    “We love you and-“
    </p>
    <p>
    “Just get out.”
    </p>
    <p>
    My mom purses her lips and leaves the room quietly. Before she shuts the door she leans back in the frame. “We’ll talk more in the morning after lock down. Good night Gail. Love you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    I don’t say anything back. I look out my window towards the border. The remaining smoke haze is over the horizon discoloring the setting sun’s rays.
    There’s only about an hour at most until its lock down and all Pales must remain inside for the night. Night is for the rogues.
    It’s when their day starts…they work the jobs considered beneath Pales, enjoy things that are banned from our borders, and live in a world separate from us.
    The only way for Pales to catch a glimpse of their world is too sneak out. I text Jessica to see if she’s still showing up tonight.
    We’re suppose to head out to a bonfire up in the woods, but with the firebombs out by the border I don’t know if anyone wants to risks getting caught by the Shields.
    They’re sure be out patrolling tonight. My phone goes off, it’s Jessica saying she’ll be here a half hour after lockdown. Fuck yeah looks like ain’t nobody scared of the Shields tonight. What they going to do?
    </p>
    <p>
    All the lights in the valley are off and a routine calm settles in the house as lockdown is announced over the speakers in the street. I quietly get ready to head out. Putting on jeans and a hoody. The usual.
    I wait for about fifteen minutes after lockdown before I slowly open my window. I step out onto the awning of the roof. My heart stops just as I’m sliding it down. My parents voices. They’re arguing. I can’t hear what its about but am sure its about my grades.
    I shake away the thought and close my window. I cringe as it slips from my fingers closing too loudly. Fuck. My eyes snap to my parents window just too be sure they didn’t hear. I let out a sigh when I still hear them going at each other’s throats.
    I shuffle to the end of the roof where a large column connects to the porch. I shimmy down easy and book it down the drive. At the gate I see Jessica’s pale yellow jeep sitting with its lights off. I hope in. “Hey, girlie. You ready?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fuck yeah I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
    	I see her give me a once over. “You’re wearing that?”
    </p>
    <p>
    	“Really? Please we’re going to a bonfire.” I look at her cropped sweater and skirt with wedges. On top of that her perfectly blonde hair is all done up with heavy makeup that looks like her face is photoshopped. “I’m pretty sure I’m dressed better for it than you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yeah but Tait’s going to be there and-“
    </p>
    <p>
    	“So? Like I give a shit.”
    </p>
    <p>
    	“Come on. I know you like him at least a bit even if you broke his heart by not going to prom with him.”
    </p>
    <p>
    	“Nope.”
    </p>
    <p>
    	“Uh-huh sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
    	I shake my head and turn up the music. Pop shit. I give her the side eye and change it to some better music.
    	Five minutes deep into back roads and pine trees close in along side us. Rocks kick up behind the tires disappears in the plumes of dust. The light emitting from the bonfire at Greywater camp glows through the gaps in between the trees.
      Silhouettes of people move through in and out of sight. We pull up along side a few other cars. About twenty others are already there with a cooler full of bitch beer and a few cases of bud by the fire. A couple bottles of cheap shit is being passed around.
      Jessica smiles widely and hops out. Tait’s truck is closest to the fire with all the doors open and music blasting. Him and a few of the boys are on the tailgate. He gives me a weak smile and comes over to me and Jessica. “Hey ladies you made it.”
    	“Of course we made it. It’s the warm up party for next week,” she replies in a tone only dogs should be able to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
    	“Yeah well I was worried ‘cause-,” he begins to say. I look away from him. “You want something to drink,” he finishes with an awkward smile.
    </p>
    <p>
    	“Is there any Hard Lemonade,” Jessica asks. I can’t help but roll my eyes of course she wants that sweet shit.
    </p>
    <p>
    	 “Gail?”
    </p>
     <p>
    	“You should know better by now,” I reply.
    </p>
    <p>
    	“I should. Whiskey it is.” He grabs a bottle of hard lemonade and hands it to her. After he looks around searching for the bottle of Jack that being passed around. I follow Tait’s point of vision to a group of three standing on the rocky shore of the lake.
      I know one of them is Aaron. A fucking preppy senior that lives outside of town in one of them fucking fortresses that the Rogues try to destroy. His parents are well off and he’s spoiled. The other two of them I don’t recognize and wonder if they go to the school across town.
       The only girl of the group has torn up jeans with an army green jacket. The guy I don’t recognize is  in slightly baggy jeans with a white hoody’s. He’s the one holding the bottle. “Hey,” Tait says. All three look his way.  He steps forward. “Can I get the whiskey,” he asks.
     </p>
     <p>
    “Oh yeah,” the guy in white says. He comes over to our group and hands Tait the bottle. I notice the is the subtle cologne that smells like mahogany and something I can’t pin point. Then the tattoos across his left hand. As he passes the bottle over.
    He has a strong square jaw with sharp cheekbones and a slightly crooked nose. I can tell he spends a bit too much time on his looks with the tribal design that fades along the sides of his hair and his groomed goatee. His amber looking eyes meet mine for a just a moment.
    Tait puts the bottle in my hands. I don’t hesitate and just wipe the rim of the bottle before taking a pull.
  </P>
  <p>
    I see a small smirk at the corner of the guys mouth. “Easy girl,” he says.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tait extends his hand out to the guy. “I haven’t seen you around. I’m Tait.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Walker,” he replies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taits gestures towards us. “This is Jessica and Gail.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Nice to meet ya.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “So where you from?” Jessica asks.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Just up north me and my friend are staying here for a couple nights.”
  </p>
  <p>
    I see his friends wave him over. Walker nods. “I’ll catch ya later,” he says as he walks away. He looks back a gives me a smile before rejoining his group.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jessica nudges me on the shoulder. “He’s cute.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Tait rolls his eyes. “Really? That guy.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “He’s pretty. And by pretty I mean that boy spends more time in the mirror than you.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Whatever but you can’t deny that he’s cute.”
    I look over at Walker and internally agree with Jessica but don’t let her see it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Damn drunk bitches are going to be drunk bitches and thats all I can think of too explain most of the party deciding to jump into the lake. That shit gots to be fucking cold still.
    Aww well. I take a seat next to the fire on an old log that was made into a make shift bench. I take out my smokes just as Walker comes up next to me. “Ya mind.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Nope.” I scoot over as he moves to sit by me.
  </p>
  <p>
    He grabs the nearly empty bottle of Nasty Nick and takes a pull. “So why aren’t you out there with your friends.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “It’s too damn cold and I ain’t that drunk.” I take the bottle from him and take a sip. I’m buzzing a bit but nothing bad just feeling a bit numb is all.
  </p>
  <p>
    “So why ain’t you out there.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “I wanted to come and see you.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Oh really?” I say as I put my cigarette between my lips. I pat my pockets trying to figure out where my lighter is. Damn. Walker pulls one out. He holds it out with his hand covering the flame from the side. I take a small drag before sitting up right again.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Thanks,”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Anytime.” He takes another drink. “So what’s your story.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “What do you mean? Just school and you know worrying about prom.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Walker starts fuckin laughing. “I’m sure you ain’t worried about prom.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Not really.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “So for real?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Well school. My parents want me to go to one of the business universities.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “So what’s so bad about that.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “I want to go to the arts university on the other side of the town border.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Walkers eyes get big. “Really?”
  </p>
  <p>
    I smile. “Yeah.” I take a drag off my cigarette and finish the bottle. “So what about you? Going to one of the universities?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Naw. Straight to work. If I could I would but-“ he pauses and rubs he hand up along his neck. I catch a glimpse of another tattoo at the base of his neck just above his collar bone. “Just aint in the cards.” Silence creeps in and it starts to feel fucking awkward.
  </p>
  <p>
    I glance over at him. Does he feel awkward? Fuck. I finish my cigarette and flick it into the fire. I look up to the night sky where the stars are scattered on a deep royal blue  back drop with the early morning sun lighting up at the edges of the horizon. “You have a beautiful smile.”
  </p>
  <p>
  “What?” I say not even realizing I have a grin on my face. It fades as I briefly look at him, but  I can’t stand looking him right in the eye. I turn away blushing.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Hey,” he says placing the tips of his fingertips along my jawline. “Don’t do that. Gail, look at me.”
  </p>
  <p>
    I force myself to do as he asks. His amber eyes don’t waiver as he moves closer gently pulling me into him. He pauses when our foreheads lean against one another. Walker smirks but doesn’t make a move. I place my hand over his.
    I intertwine our fingers noticing how rough the pads of his palms are. My hearts pounding and I know that I must be bright red now. I finally lean into him. Our lips barley brush against each other. When Tait comes out from the lake screaming, “Gail.”
    I snap my head around to see Tait holding Jessica up against his body. “What?” I ask.
  </p>
  <p>
    “We gotta get going. Jessica is really out of it,” he say. Tait’s soaking wet but he’s holding his own pretty good and he isn’t slurring anymore. At least the dip in the water sobered him up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I purse my lips together and say, “Fine. But who’s going to drive you truck home?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “You?”
  </p>
  <p>
    “I can’t drive stick.” I turn to Walker. “Can you?” I ask.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Please. Of course.” I roll my eyes and give him a little shove.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I can drive but you’re gonna have to take me out to Aaron’s.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Yeah whatever.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Tait and Walker get a very drunk and stumbling Jessica into her Jeep. Tait tossing Walker his truck keys. He gives them to me. “Get loaded up. I’m gonna go find Aaron fast.”
  </p>
  <p>
    I get in the truck and start it turning up the heat. It may be getting warm in the day but its still chilly out especially next to the lake. I put on some music and wait for Walker. It takes a minute but soon he gets in and pulls up behind Jessica’s yellow Jeep.
    Tait pulls out and turns down the dirt road. Walker keeps far enough way so dust is blinding us from seeing. He reaches out and tugs on my sweater. I scoot over to him letting him put his arm around my shoulder. I nuzzle into his chest.
    The cologne I loved before is now being over powered with the smell of cigarettes and whiskey. I tentatively place my hand over his abdomen.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Shit!” Walker releases me from his hold to down shift in time to keep from ass punching Jessica’s Jeep. Tait had stopped in the middle of the road. Its being blocked off by a Shield patrol man. Fuck. The Shields pure white squad cars are parked diagonal across the road.
    Walker leans back against the seat with his lips pursed. “Fuck,” he says. The Shields get out with their flashlights up and come up to both the vehicles. The Shield points the light into the truck and scans the few bottles tossed in here.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Have you been drinking?” he asks popping his gum.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Nope.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “I’m going to need you both to step out of the vehicle.”
  </p>
  <p>
    They make us line up by the road. Once they start lecturing us about our fucking curfew and drinking I tune out. I roll my eyes when they break out the I.I.D. scanner so they know where to bring us home.
    All Pales and Rogues get chips put into our wrists when we’re born so they know everything about us and what classification we are. This isn’t our first time or last time having to be brought home by them. I hold out my wrist.
    The Shield wraps his clammy sausage fingers around my wrist and I about pull back before he can scan it. It lights up green and brings up my picture.  Walker is beside me at the end of our line of misfits. He stands up straight and looks him right in the eye.
    The Shield has to pull out his wrist to scan when Walker refuses to hold it out for him. The scanner glows red.
  </p>
  <p class="first line-p">
  <p class="first letter-p">
    What the fuck? Red. He is a Rogue. My chest tightens and my breathing comes out in short bursts as I watch the Shields pat Walker down for weapons. I try to swallow down the large lump building in the back of my throat as they pulls his hands behind his back and cuff him.
    Tears warm my cheek. Why am I crying? Walker’s watching me as the Shields attempt to lead him to their squad car but he struggles with them. He steps forward to me and leans into me. Walker places a kiss on my cheek. “Don’t cry baby girl,” he whispers as they pull him away from me.
    They shove him into one of the squad cars. I place my hand where he kissed me. Will I ever see him again?
