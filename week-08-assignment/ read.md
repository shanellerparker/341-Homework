### Introduction...or a seemingly huge wave of knowledge
  So this week was quite the expericence. I started out reading the matieral and much like HTML
  in the beginning it was a lot to take in. However, I thought that I would be alright
  because of already getting pretty alright with HTML. I was wrong...very wrong. I mean
  I feel like it's the beginning of the semester again.

### Too Much to do not ENOUGH TIME
  So I was not able to get my webpage running suficiently. I worked on it for the better part
  of the last few days after I reviewed everything. I don't know why this is such a struggle
  for me. It feel more difficult than HTML. It was very discouraging to that I was not able to
  get the website that I had in mind right and I am sure I did not meet the requirments for this assignment.
  I am going to review more for sure and see if I can edit it this week so I can at least help myself
  feel better even if it won't necessarily count towards anything.

### Over...
  So I learned alot but also learned that I didn't know the matieral as well as I thought I did. I am still going
  to try to fix my site, but not tonight...no it was a bit too much. I enjoy all the intricacies that go into
  web designing, but this week by far was the most overwhelming.
