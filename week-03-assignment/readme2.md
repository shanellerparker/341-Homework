# Week 3 Assignment Report Shanelle Parker-50

## Introduction
This week it was a major benefit to have extra time to be able to absorb all of the information thrown my way. This week we learned about html and how to make our content 'live'.
## A Breeze
I was very thankful to have the extra time to absorb all the material and review. I feel like this made this assignment more managible. I was very excited to learn about html and was thrilled when the first html actually opened in chrome! I would love to learn more about this topic to make a more visually appealing webpage.
## All Done
I am happy that this assignment is done and am looking forward to the next one. I am finding this course very helpful and am excited to utilise what I learn.
