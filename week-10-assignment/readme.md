### Introduction
  So this week was a bit less complicated than the previous weeks work. We
  were able to learn about various topics pertaining to RWD. This was
  very useful because of the diverse ways that RWD can be utilized. I was
  happy to get better knowledge of this because I can now update my own
  personal website with this new knowledge.

### Finshed...already...
  I thought that I was done writing the html/css already. But ran into a
  couple bugs. I was a bit irritated ultil I noticed that the first line
  in the index.html had been partly erased...and felt a bit like a dummy
  for it. But at least it was simple to fix.
### Sketch...
  This was by far the hardest and easiest part of the assignment that I
  worked on. I had to give a lot of thought to what I wanted. I have been
  hashing out some ideas previously but was letting the OCD part of me
  get to involved. It took me forever to come up with this layout. I really
  wanted it to be just right.
