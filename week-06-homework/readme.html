  ###Introudction
This week was very busy and it was hard to take in alot of the material.
I ended up googling a few things and looking up tutorials on youtube.
It was mostly just trying to tie everything together from this week and
in previous weeks.

  ### Yay!
I must say that after all of the work I put into trying to find videos...
I am happy to say that I finally found some that will work but I couldn't officially
host a video...a bit disappointed but its just two embedded videos. Hopefully that
will be okay and if not I really can't do anything about it right.

  ### Walking away from this...
I am happy that this assignment is all done. I always am frustrated during, relieved after,
and am thrilled with how much knowledge that I am gaining form this class so I am excited for the next one.
