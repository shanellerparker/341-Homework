# Week 2 Assignment Report-Shanelle Parker

## Introduction
This week there was a ton of material thrown a me that I have not previously known about. These Included;
-sourcetree
-atom
-commands within the terminal
However, I found all of this information very useful in the longterm and worth the shortterm frustration. The little steps from working with text editors to markdown language while working with github.
## Struggling
The initial steps I'd taken to complete this assignment wasn't very productive. I tried to rush through everything without actually learning how to do it. I got very frustrated but I stepped back and read over the material, watched the videos several times, and found youtube very helpful. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRTckrrCME4) This video and a couple other by the same channel helped me start over again with a better understanding. They helped me understand the few problems with git commands and how specific they need to be.
## Done at Last
I am relieved to have this assignment done. I feel like this was a pretty big step in web design for me. I think I would like to learn a bit more of the commands for git and possibly more on the markdown language. I am going to be honest and say that I struggled to keep up with this class this week due to my accounting class. Because of this I didn't make it to the issues page long enough to help one of my classmates. I will do better in future assignments.
